Plantable Machines
---
Machines or entities that can be planted on ground by players. With required callbacks and functions so very modifiable.

Callbacks can be used to determine the effect of machine on other players based on custom requirements. 

---
Has proper bounds checking so the player can't plant above certain threshold that is configurable, also checks theres nothing in front of player blocking like a wall, so the machine can be planted properly in required space.
